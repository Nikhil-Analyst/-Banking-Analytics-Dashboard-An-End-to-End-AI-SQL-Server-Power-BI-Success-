# Banking-Analytics-Dashboard-An-End-to-End-AI-SQL-Server-Power-BI-Success-


I’m excited to unveil my latest data analytics project—a comprehensive banking dashboard created from scratch. What makes this project unique is that every major workflow was enhanced by Perplexity AI and powered by a robust SQL Server and Power BI integration.

🔎 Project Pipeline at a Glance:

Data Modelling & Storage:
All raw banking data (customers, accounts, transactions) was stored and organized within Microsoft SQL Server. Using SQL Server offered advantages in scalability, relational integrity, and fast query performance—laying the groundwork for a modern data-driven solution.

Data Integration & Transfer:
Using secure server connections, I imported the cleansed and modeled data directly into Power BI. The “Get Data” feature in Power BI made it simple to plug into SQL Server, select my tables/views, and maintain live or scheduled refreshes so the dashboard always reflects the most current database state.

Advanced Analytics with AI:
Every DAX measure, KPI, and visual concept was envisioned, refined, and problem-solved in partnership with Perplexity AI. The AI guided best practices for data transformation, suggested optimal chart types for different use cases, and even generated advanced DAX expressions for business logic (for example, cohort analysis, time trends, and account segmentation).

Visual Storytelling in Power BI:

Page 1: Customer demographics, account balances, geographic splits, and product-type representation.

Page 2: Transaction KPIs, monthly financial flows, customer value breakdowns, and risk/event flags.

💡 Why is this important?

SQL Server ensured robust, centralized data storage and made it easy to maintain and share a “single source of truth.”

Perplexity AI sped up every phase: data modeling, code generation, analytics planning, and dashboard UX—acting like an expert partner in decision-making.

This project proves that AI + robust server infrastructure + modern BI tools can empower anyone to build enterprise-grade solutions quickly and efficiently.
